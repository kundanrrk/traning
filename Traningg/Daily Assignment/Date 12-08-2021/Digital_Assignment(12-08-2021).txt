1.What is sql injection, how to resolve the same in java.
Ans:sql injection is a code technique that might cause loss to our database.sql injection can be used to manipulate the application web server by malicious users.
sql injection generally occurs when we ask a user to input their username/userid.we can resolve by proper input validation.
a.valid input
b.prepare a query
c.create the prepared statement
d.pass the parameter to the prepared statement
e.execute your query
f.validate your application


2.what is the exception hierarchy.
Ans:In Java an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instruction is called an exception.
The class at the top of the exception class hierarchy is the Throwable class, which is a direct subclass of the Object class. 
Throwable has two direct subclasses-exception and error.  
the root class for all the exception in the hierarchy of exception  class is java.lang.Trowable


3.how will you decide to choose between inferface and abstract?
use an abstract class if you have some funtionality that you want its subclass to have.for instance,if you have a set of functions that you want all of the base abstract class subclasses to have.
use an interface if want a general contract on behavior/functionality.


4.what is the difference between == and equals?
Ans:== checks if both object point to the same memory location
equals() evaluate to the comparision of values in the object.


5.what is the difference between throw and throws?
Ans:Throw: java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw exception.
throw is followed by an instance.
throw is used with in a method.
you cannot throw an multiple exception.
Throws: java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
Throws is followed by java.
Throws is used with in the method signature.
you can declare multiple exceptions
eg:public void method()throws
IOException, SQLException.

example of throw:

public class TestThrow {  
    
    public static void checkNum(int num) {  
        if (num < 1) {  
            throw new ArithmeticException("\nNumber is negative, cannot calculate square");  
        }  
        else {  
            System.out.println("Square of " + num + " is " + (num*num));  
        }  
    }  
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
            TestThrow obj = new TestThrow();  
            obj.checkNum(-3);  
            System.out.println("Rest of the code..");  
    }  
}  


example of throws:

public class TestThrows {  
    
    public static int divideNum(int m, int n) throws ArithmeticException {  
        int div = m / n;  
        return div;  
    }  
   
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        TestThrows obj = new TestThrows();  
        try {  
            System.out.println(obj.divideNum(45, 0));  
        }  
        catch (ArithmeticException e){  
            System.out.println("\nNumber cannot be divided by 0");  
        }  
          
        System.out.println("Rest of the code..");  
    }  
} 

  
 6.what is the use of the toString method?
Ans:thetostring method returns a string it is representation of object in java.
by default the tostring method returns the name of the object class its hash code
Example:
public class TestToString

{

public static void main(String[] args)

{

Employee emp = new Employee(“Martinez”,

“Anthony”);

System.out.println(emp.toString());

}

}

class Employee

{

private String lastName;

private String firstName;

public Employee(String lastName, String firstName)

{

this.lastName = lastName;

this.firstName = firstName;

}

}
7.what is immutable in java?
ANS: immutable means once an object is created,we cannot change its content.in java all wrapper classes and string class is immutable.
         example:string is an immutable class and once instantiated its value never changes.



8.what fails fast in collections mean,how can ve resolve it?
Ans  fail fast iterators checks the modCount flag whenever it gets the next value,and if it finds that the modcount
 has been modified after this iterator has been created,it throws concurrentmodificationexception.

9.what is the benifit of string tokenizer?
Ans:The string tokenzier class allow an application to break a string into tokens.the string tokenizer method do not distinquish among identifiers,numbers.

10.How are string,string buffer and string builder different from each other?
Ans:strings in java are objects that are backed internally by char array,strings are immutable.
stringBuffer:String buffer is less efficient than string builder
stringBuilder: stringbuilder is more efficient than stringbuffer
